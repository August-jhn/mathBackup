\fbox{theorem} Suppose $f$ is analytic in a domain $D$ that contains a segment of the real axis $S$, and that $D$ is symmetric about the real axis. Then $\overline{f(\overline{z})} = f(\overline{z})$ for all $z\in D$, iff $f(z)$ is real for all $x\in S$ \\
\fbox{proof} \\

Let $F(z) = \overline{f(\overline{z})}$. Let $f(z) = u(z,y) + iv(x,y)$ and $F(z) = U(x,y)+i V(x,y)$. Then $\overline{F(z)} = u(x,y) - iv(x,y)$. \\

Suppose now that $F(z) = f(z)$. Let $F(x+i0) = u(x,0)- iv(x,0) = f(x+i0) = u(x,0) + iv(x,0).$ But since $F(x) = f(x)$ it follows that $v(x,0) = 0$. So $f(x)$ is real for all $x\in S$.\\

Suppose $f(x)$ is real for all $x\in S$. Since $f$ is analytic, it must satisfy the Cauchy Reimann equatinos, hence
$$u_x(x,y) = v_y(x,y)\mbox{ and }u_x(x,y) = v_x(x,y).$$ Then 
$$ \pder{x}$$
So $F$ must be analytic because it satisfies the CR equations.\\
By assumption, $F(x) = f(x)$ for all $x\in S$. Then by uniqueness, $F(z) = f(z)$ in $D$, hence $\overline{f(x)} = \overline{F(z)} = f(\overline{z})$
